/**********************************************************************
Introduction
**********************************************************************/

	SimpleAuth is a very simple user authentication scheme using PHP
	sessions and a MySQL database.  The code itself is highly commented
	and is meant as a demonstration for beginners in PHP as to how you
	can easily create a multi-user website using PHP and MySQL.

	Please note that this code is VERY basic(!) and is really only meant
	as a 'demonstration' of a simple authentication scheme - you should
	consider modifying it for your own needs.

	For a list of Frequently Asked Questions (and their answers!),
	please see the FAQ file or visit the forum at:

	There are also a large number of posts on the forum, so please
	search before asking questions!

Installation
**********************************************************************/

	1.  Move the the file simpleauth.tar.gz into your public HTML
		folder. If you are unsure where this is, ask your system
		administrator:

		dave@users /home/dave# mv simpleauth.tar.gz public_html

		Note:
		-----
		You will need to change the commandline above to use the name of
		the distribution tarball - ie simpleauth-1.2.tar.gz 


	2.  Change into the public HTML folder and untar the
		simpleauth.tar.gz tarball:

		dave@users /home/dave# cd web
		dave@users /home/dave/public_html# tar zxvf simpleauth.tar.gz
		simpleauth/
		simpleauth/functions.php
		simpleauth/login.php
		simpleauth/join.php
		simpleauth/config.php
		simpleauth/members.php
		simpleauth/logout.php
		simpleauth/users.sql
		simpleauth/index.php


	3.  Change into the 'simpleauth' folder created in step 2 above:

		dave@users /home/dave/public_html# cd simpleauth


	4.  Create the MySQL 'user' table in your MySQL database:

		dave@users /home/dave/public_html/simpleauth# mysql -u dave -p dave < users.sql
		Enter password: <ENTER YOUR PASSWORD WHEN PROMPTED>

		Note:
		-----
		This previous step is an example only, which basically means
		'execute all the sql statements in the file users.sql on the
		database 'dave', using the mysql account 'dave' and prompt me
		for my password'.  Change your username / database name as
		required.


	5.  Modify the following lines in 'config.php' in the 'simpleauth'
		folder to the details specific for your own database:

		$dbhost="localhost";
		$dbuser="CHANGE_ME";
		$dbpass="CHANGE_ME";
		$dbname="CHANGE_ME";

		Note:
		-----
		These will be the same as you used in the previous step above.

	6.  Finally, open the 'simpleauth' folder location in your browser.
		You should see a description of all the files in the simpleauth
		package, together with links to each of the front-end php
		scripts.

		Test the installation by clicking on the 'join.php' link and
		creating a new user.  If all went well the new user will be
		added to the 'users' mysql table and you will be forwarded to
		the 'members.php' page.
